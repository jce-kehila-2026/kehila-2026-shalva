# Team Workflow

This page documents the Team Workflow used in the GitHub Workflow Workshop. Team members can copy this content into the repository Wiki if desired.

## Assignments

1. Create an issue for each new task and assign one team member.
2. Create a branch for that issue (use a descriptive branch name, e.g. `feature/readme-team-intro`).
3. Make and commit changes in the branch using the web editor.
4. Open a Pull Request from the branch into `main` and include `Closes #<issue-number>` in the PR description to link the issue.
5. Request at least one teammate to review the PR.
6. After review approval, merge the PR into `main` and (optionally) delete the branch.
7. Move the issue card on the project board to `Done`.

## Example PR description

## Notes for instructors

- Students should confirm each checklist item is completed: issue assigned, branch created, commit made, PR opened, review performed, PR merged, and project card moved to Done.
